This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

- Stripe integration for handling payments (@stripe/react-stripe-js, @stripe/stripe-js)
- HTTP requests via axios
- Persistent storage with localforage
- Firebase integration for user authentication
- RESTful API built using Express
- MongoDB as the database
- JWT-based authentication (jsonwebtoken)
- Stripe API for payment processing (stripe)
